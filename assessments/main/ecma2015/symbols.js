 Metaprogramming is (loosely) all about the underlying mechanics of the language,
 rather than “high level” data modelling or business logic

 - Code generation: eval
 - Reflection: apply, call, bind, name, length (Function), getOwnProperties (Object)
 - Reflection / Introspection: typeof, delete, instanceof
 - Reflection through implementation: Symbols (to change the behaviour of classes and objects)
 - Reflection through introspection - Reflect (used to discover very low level information about your code)
 - Reflection through intercession - Proxy (wrapping objects and intercepting their behaviours)
