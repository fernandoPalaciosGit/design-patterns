 Metaprogramming is (loosely) all about the underlying mechanics of the language,

 - Reflection: apply, call, bind, name, length (Function), getOwnProperties (Object)
 - Reflection / Introspection: typeof, delete, instanceof
 - Reflection through introspection - Reflect (used to discover very low level information about your code)
